<p>I thought to Build a Machine Learning Model to generate Emojis for My Writing content</p>

<p>Like when typing some sentences, I think I need relevant Emojis in the sentences, as it will give more expressiveness, right</p>

<p>And also because currently I am searching in Web(using some website like Emoji Finder etc., it is based on keywords only) to pick Emojis</p>

<p>So I decided to Develop a <strong>LSTM Model</strong> to automatically generate Emoji for My Sentences</p>

<h2 id="demo">🎥 First Demo</h2>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2025-08-24-emoji-generator/output.gif" alt="Demo Video" /></p>

<h2 id="-explanation">🧑‍🏫 Explanation</h2>

<p>When the user types the paragraph, for each paragraph the Model predicts the approximate Emoji</p>

<p>For example, if you have 5 sentences in a paragraph, the Model will generate 5 Emojis</p>

<h2 id="technical-details">⚙️ Technical Details</h2>

<p>I currently have totally 20 Emojis ❤, 😍, 😂, 💕, 🔥, 😊, 😎, ✨, 💙, 😘, 📷, 🇺🇸, ☀, 💜, 😉, 💯, 😁, 🎄, 📸, 😜</p>

<p>And used Dataset from <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/cardiffnlp/tweet_eval">Hugging Face</a> and used Google Colab for Training</p>

<h3 id="model-selection">🎯 Model Selection</h3>

<p>I have decided to use BiLSTM(Bidirectional LSTM(Long Short-Term Memory))</p>

<p>We could have just used <strong>LSTM</strong> rather then <strong>BiLSTM</strong> as we are not doing Seq2Seq Task, like we are not translating English to Emojis</p>

<p>But, here <strong>BiLSTM</strong> improves the performance by at least 10%</p>

<p>So, decided to use <strong>BiLSTM</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note :</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here we could have used BiLSTM with Attention Mechanism or even  Fine-Tuned Pre Trained Model like BERT</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>But decided to use BiLSTM</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="architecture">🏗️ Architecture</h3>

<ol>
  <li>First have used Embedding Layer</li>
  <li>Then, BiLSTM with 2 Layers</li>
  <li>Dropout for Regularization</li>
  <li>Then Linear Layer with 20 output units for each Emojis
    <ul>
      <li>Note :</li>
      <li>We are using BiLSTM, so it will hidden states from both the directions</li>
      <li>So, before passing to Linear Layer we must concatenate both the hidden states</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="hyperparameters">🎲 Hyperparameters</h3>

<ol>
  <li>I have used the Maximum length of the Sequence to be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">50</code></li>
  <li>Embedding Dimension as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">128</code></li>
  <li>Hidden Dimension for LSTM States to be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">128</code></li>
  <li>As stated before, we have chosen Number of Layers to be 2</li>
  <li>Learning Rate α : 0.0005</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="accuracy-and-important-study">🚨 Accuracy and Important Study</h3>

<p>Regarding Accuracy, it is relatively low although with <strong>BiLSTM</strong> and even low with <strong>Unidirectional LSTM</strong></p>

<p>Was tweaking and trying to improve the performance then LATER ONLY realized that data has Class Imbalance Problem</p>

<p>Where ~21% of the Data has “❤” which dominates most and followed by ~10% of Data has “😍” and so on… then “😜” was barely minimum</p>

<h4 id="️-important-action">⚠️ Important action</h4>

<p>🥇 First Rule : Data in Training Set, Development Set and Test Set should follow the same Distribution</p>

<p>Followed by, may be here, we can Augmented Data Synthetically, or may be with some other Architecture so on</p>

<p>Yes, we can also increase Accuracy with the same Data but as of now saved that for later</p>

<h3 id="little-history">📜 Little History</h3>

<p>I have used Regular LSTM and saw the Model was Overfitting</p>

<p>So, of various Hyperparameters(still overfitting) after few tweaking various Hyperparameters along with  BiLSTM showed little improvement and continued and seems to work fine</p>
